# Restaurant Search - A React Native Exploration

This React Native application allows users to search for restaurants using the Yelp API, groups them by cost, and displays an overview of each restaurant. Users can tap on a restaurant to view more photos.

This project was another step in my journey to deepen my understanding of React Native.

**Features:**

*   Search for restaurants using the Yelp API.
*   Group restaurants by cost (e.g., \$, \$\$, \$\$\$).
*   Display an overview of each restaurant (name, rating, image, etc.).
*   View more photos of a restaurant when tapped.

**Note:** This app focuses on learning and implementing core React Native concepts and API integration.
